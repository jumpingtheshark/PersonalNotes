November 30th- so far, going great!!!
Next, create models and run migrations!!!!!


And get that crud done!!!!

What do I need I think I need to do get started?

There's no way that I'll remember it by heart...

.. but..
in the misha app -
add urls.py? right, with like "/" path or something


then.. in the views.py add a corresponding view.

and then...
import the whole thing to the default (site) urls.py with a
 path("", include("MishaApp.urls"), name="home")...
 which I somehow still don't understand.

 The idea of this thing is allow people to sign up for skokiejobs.gov.
